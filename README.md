## GDD
* Rules:
  * Destroy the other player
  * Get a highsore
* Requirements:
  * ~~Realistic~~ enviroment: hills, trees, mountains, 
  * Sound FX: moving tank sounds, ambient music etc.
  * Particle FX: firing smoke trail, explosion, ultra mega nuke'em explosion, etc... (you know, stuff like that)
  
_Realistic enviroment vs._ (might possibly end with this ... _maybe_)
> pros:
* Quixel Megascans (hyper realistic)
* beatiful enviroment - those mountains tho
> cons:
* Much more time instensive
* I don't understand textures... much learning 

_Stylized enviroment_ __(probably will start with this)__
> pros:
* Can focus more on gameplay/mechanics
* Less time (at maximum 3 colors for enviroment, etc.) (textures + colors in blueprints)
> cons:
* Not good assets
* Tank is realistic
* I want to (eventually make a realistic game ... you're the one, Harry?)
